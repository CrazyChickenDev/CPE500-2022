Some experts are of the opinion that there is a yearning gap between the learning acquired by Nigerian 
graduates of Nigerian universities and the application of the skills required in the workplace. Clearly, 
academic learning and theoretical knowledge alone would not usually prepare an educated person for 
the world of work. Consequently, a worker must not only bring knowledge but must also be versatile 
in the application of skills required to perform defined jobs and work. This requirement is particularly 
crucial for graduates of science, engineering, agriculture, and technology disciplines. This need for 
practical know-how gave birth to the SIWES program. 
The Studentsâ€™ Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is a skill training program designed to 
expose and prepare students of universities, polytechnics and Colleges of Education for the industrial 
work situation they are likely to meet after graduation. The scheme also affords students the 
opportunity of familiarizing and exposing themselves to the needed experience in handling equipment 
and machinery that are usually not available in their institutions.
